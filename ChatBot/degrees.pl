Many business enterprises in Sri Lanka belong to the small business category. Most of these enterprises are located outside the capital city of Colombo. Employment in the rural sector is also generated by small business ventures. The government has recognized the socio economic significance of the small business sector and has instituted policies to encourage and promote small business activities. Conditions conducive for small business ventures exist in Sri Lanka. In spite of this, many small ventures have failed or have suffered slow growth. Reasons for such failures appear to be related to selection procedures of the ventures and improper management of the business.\n\n
